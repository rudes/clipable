# Clipable

## Testing

```Batch
cargo build
dev_install.bat
```

## Notes

- need to store streamable credentials somewhere, probably registry
- could also be service params
- when a new .mp4 that's < 1gb hits the folder, upload to streamable
- save streamable URL in a txt file with the .mp4 file name
