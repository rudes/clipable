# Clipable

## Installation

```bash
cargo wix
```
Then run the generated MSI in target/wix

## Usage

I use this in conjunction with Nvidia Shadowplay or AMD Instant Replay. I record the last 3 minutes of my screen to a different directory. I then right click the file and "open with" the Photos application, this gives you the ability to Trim the video down to the useful clip (last few seconds), then save this file to the clipable directory.
